First time:

UDP 1812
UDP 1813
Needs opening for shorewall

apt-get install freeradius freeradius-ldap
replace /etc/freeradius files with ones in freeradius.tar.gz


Others:
edit /etc/freeradius/clients.conf and change CHANGEME secret for localhost. Also add a client for the subnet in use plus a secret.
Like (might need to set this so easy to change with sed, as its in a specific place):

client 172.30.0.0/16 {
        secret          = CHANGEME
        shortname       = schoolwirelessnetwork
}




edit /etc/freeradius/modules/ldap and edit IP address of ldap server (curently 127.0.0.1)
  
cp in own certificates if wish to use own rather than autogenerated to /etc/freeradius/certs/
