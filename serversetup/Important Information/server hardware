This project is designed to be used in schools so fancy SCSI raid systems with hot swap drives are not going to get a look in.

Here is an example of the type of hardware we have used (Please see details on the website: www.karoshi.org.uk for a full description)

The two larger hard drives are software raided together in a raid0 configuration to give around 300Gb of space. The other hard drive is for the operating system.
Raid0 has no backup if one of the drives should fail so having a backup would be useful, which is why we have the backup server(sal) with 500gb of storage. This should be located as far away from the server room as possible in a secure area so that in the event of a fire in the server room you will still have your backup.
